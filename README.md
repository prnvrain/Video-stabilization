# Video-stabilization
This GitHub repository offers a video stabilization solution using template matching algorithms. It includes code for identifying correspondences between frames and applying stabilization techniques to reduce motion artifacts, resulting in smoother and more stable videos.

# Template Matching
Template-based methods for video stabilization rely on tracking a fixed template or patch of pixels within the video frames. The template can be a specific image feature, such as an object or a region of interest, or a fixed-size patch selected from the video frame. The method tracks the movement of the template or patch across frames and uses this information to estimate the camera motion between frames. The camera motion is then compensated by transforming the frames to align them with a reference frame.

Template-based methods have the advantage of being computationally efficient and robust to changes in scene content. However, they may struggle with scenes that contain a lot of motion or changes in the template over time. They may also require careful selection and initialization of the template or patch to be tracked.
